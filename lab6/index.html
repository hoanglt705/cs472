        //Exercise 1:
        //    Define a filter function on the String object. The function accepts an array of strings that
        //    specifies a list of banned words. The function returns the string after removing all the
        //    banned words.
        //    Example:
        //    console.log("This house is not nice!".filter('not'));
        //    Output: "This house is nice!"
        String.prototype.filter = function(...bannedWords) 
        {
            let result = this;
            for (let word of bannedWords) 
            {
                result = result.replace(word,'')
            }
            return result.replace("  ", " ");
        };
        console.log("This house is not nice!".filter('not'));

        //Exercise 2:
        //    Write a BubbleSort algorithm on the Array object. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm
        //    that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted,
        //    Example:[6,4,0, 3,-2,1].bubbleSort();
        //    Output : [-2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6]

        Array.prototype.bubbleSort = function() 
        {
            var is_sorted = false;
            while (!is_sorted) 
            {
                is_sorted = true;
                for (var n = 0; n < this.length - 1; n++) 
                {
                if (this[n] > this[n+1]){
                    var x = this[n+1];
                    this[n+1] = this[n];
                    this[n] = x;
                    is_sorted = false;
                }
                }
            }
            return this;
        };
        console.log([6,4,0, 3,-2,1].bubbleSort());

        //Exercise 3:
        //    Create an object called Teacher derived from a Person function constructor, and implement
        //    a method called teach that receives a string called subject, and prints out: [teacher's name]
        //    is now teaching [subject]. Create a Teacher object and call its teach method.
        //    Also do the same thing using Object.create. When using Object.create you will need a
        //    factory function instead of a function constructor in order to pass parameters such as
        //    ‘name’ to be set in the prototype.
        class Person {
            constructor(name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
            teach(subject) {
                console.log("Teacher " + this.name + " is now teaching " + subject);
            }
        }

        teacher = new Person("Hoang");
        teacher.teach("math");

        const behavior = {
            teach(subject) {
                console.log("Teacher " + this.name + " is now teaching " + subject);
            }
        }

        teacher = Object.create(behavior);
        teacher.name = "Hoang"
        teacher.teach("math");

        //Exercise 4:
        //    Write code that will create person, student, and professor objects.
        //    • Person objects have
        //    o name and age fields
        //    o a greeting method that prints out: “Greetings, my name is [name] and I am
        //    [age] years old.”
        //    o a salute method that prints out: “Good morning!, and in case I dont see you,
        //    good afternoon, good evening and good night!”
        //    • Student objects inherit name, age, and salute from person. They also have a field
        //    ‘major’ and have their own greeting method. Their greeting is “Hey, my name is
        //    [name] and I am studying [major]. The greeting should be output to the console.
        //    • Professor objects inherit name, age, and salute from person. They also have a field
        //    ‘department’ and have their own greeting method. Their salutation is “Good day,
        //    my name is [name] and I am in the [department] department.” Output it to the
        //    console.
        //    • Create a professor object and a student object. Call both the greeting and salutation
        //    methods on each.
        //    • Do this exercise once using the object prototype approach for inheritance and then
        //    using the function constructor approach.
        let person = {
            name: null,
            age: null,
            greeting() {
                console.log("Greetings, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.");
            },

            salute() {
                console.log("Good morning!, and in case I dont see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night!");
            }
        }

        let student = {
            major: null,
            greeting() {
                console.log("Hey, my name is " + this.name + " and I am studying " + this.major);
            },
            __proto__: person
        }

        let professor = {
            department: null,
            greeting() {
                console.log("Good day, my name is " + this.name + " and I am in the " + this.department + " department.");
            },
            __proto__: person
        }

        person.name = "Peter";
        person.age = 35;

        student.major = "Phisycal"
        student.greeting();
        student.salute();

        professor.department = "Math"
        professor.greeting();
        professor.salute();
